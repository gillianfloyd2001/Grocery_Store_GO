# Grocery Store
In this program, I converted a command line Python benchmark to a command line Go program. 

This program will print a list of grocery store items; this list of items will contain the items name, a description of the item, the amount of items that are in the store, and the price of that item without taxes. Once the user has decided an item, the user will type the name of the item they want. The program will then print out the subtotal of your item then it will calulate the taxes on this item. Once this program calculates the taxes, it will add the taxes and the subtotal together and print out the total price of that item.
